# 🔩 Bullet Fragments — A Project Zomboid Mod

Some bullets don’t pass through.  
They twist, break, and stay buried in flesh — waiting to be found.

This mod adds metal bullet fragments to zombie corpses after they're killed with firearms. These fragments behave like scrap material and can be collected and smelted.
